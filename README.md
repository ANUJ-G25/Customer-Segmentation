# Customer-Segmentation
In this project, I worked on a customer segmentation model using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for an eCommerce dataset. The objective was to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior to enhance marketing strategies. I began by importing and preprocessing the dataset, including data cleaning and handling missing values. I then calculated RFM metrics for each customer and assigned RFM scores. Using K-Means clustering, I segmented the customers into distinct groups and profiled each segment to identify key characteristics. This analysis provided valuable insights into customer behavior and allowed for tailored marketing strategies. Additionally, I created visualizations to illustrate the RFM distribution and customer segments, and prepared a comprehensive report summarizing the methodology, findings, and actionable recommendations for improving customer retention and maximizing revenue.
